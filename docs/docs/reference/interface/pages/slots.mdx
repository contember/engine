**Use Slots to render contents of your page the other areas of the layout.**

Every Contember component can [access data binding context](/reference/interface/data-binding/overview/)
and render it to the page but this composition is limited to how the content might be rendered as is.

For example you can't render a persist button to save the form in the header from the page because
it is nested within the descendants of the page that is rendered in the layout.

To overcome this limitation slots provide a way to *escape*  and render to other parts of the layout easily, even
the parts that are not directly descendants of the page, e.g. header or footer of the layout.

## What are slots?

**Layout slots** are React components that can be used to render content in predefined
places of the layout. Each `SlotSource` can render (append) its children to the target as
[createPortal()](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal) would do.

This is useful when you want to render a button in the footer, header, sidebar or any
other place of the layout that is not directly accessible from within inside of the rendered page.

## Defining your slots

Slots are made of two pair components. One component is used to render content to the portal (source)
and the other component is used to render the content from the portal (target).

To create your slot you need to create two components:

- **SlotSource** – React component that will be used to [render content from pages](#1-rendering-content-to-slot-from-the-page)
- **SlotTarget** – React component that will be used in place where you want to render content


<CodeBlock
	language="typescript"
	title="admin/lib/components/slots.tsx"
>
	{_example_slot_define}
</CodeBlock>

## Rendering page content to a slot source

By wrapping the content in the slot source component, instead of rendering it as an immediate
descendants of the page, you will create a *portal* that will render the content to the
target component.

<CodeBlock
	language="typescript"
	title="admin/pages/my-page.tsx"
>
	{_example_slot_usage}
</CodeBlock>


## Placing slot targets in the layout

- **useHasActiveSlotsFactory()** – Hook that returns a function that returns `true` if there is any content
to render, otherwise it returns `false` which gives you even more control to compose layout.


<CodeBlock
	language="typescript"
	title="admin/libs/components/layout.tsx"
>
	{_example_slot_layout}
</CodeBlock>

:::note
Slots use `React.createPortal` under the hood. But  Slots gives you extra tools to control how your layout behaves, when there is no content to render.

## Context Providers

Using slots is optional. Their respective providers are included in our project templates in the application entry point.
Once you decide to go your own way just remove the `<Slots.Provider>` from the `index.tsx` file.
